# User Management Web Application built with PHP & MySQL
# Live example: [user-management.argiweb.com](http://user-management.argiweb.com)
## How to get started

1. Clone this repo, no need to require dependencies as I have already added the vendor directory that includes Twig templating engine
2. Make sure to point your root directory to "public" folder
3. Import SQL files into your MySQL database, this will create "users" and "admins" tables and add some data
4. Configure Config.php file (or Model.php file) by changing the credentials
5. Enjoy!

# Note!

Twig ~2.0 requires PHP 7.0< use Twig ~1.0 if your hosting is on PHP ~5.4
